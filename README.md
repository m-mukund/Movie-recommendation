A movie recommendation system made in jupyter notebook. It includes a collaborative filtering based recommender system and two content-based. 

The dataset used for the collaborative is included in the repository.

We use NLP to obtain features from the data available and use it to find the cosine similarity between movies in content-based recommendation system.

We convert each feature, represented as a list of tokens, into a vector that machine learning models can understand.

In the system we also use the count vectorizer method to find the cosine similarity (i.e. in the model which uses genres,etc).
